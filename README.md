This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug involving the CSS `calc()` function.  The bug arises from using `calc()` to determine element dimensions within a flexbox container where the container's width isn't explicitly defined. This leads to inconsistent or unexpected layout results across different browsers or screen sizes. The solution demonstrates a proper way to utilize `calc()` within flexbox to avoid these issues.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected implementation.
